Neural Machine Translation
Your Task is to:
1. Build a Neural Machine Translation model.
2. Evaluate your model using BLEU score.
Dataset: http://www.manythings.org/anki/fra-eng.zip
Notes
1. You can resubmit till your code is not evaluated by TA.
2. Refer notes for hint.
Comments : Your code must have proper comments for better understanding.
Score : Score will be given by the TA based on your submission.
Submission : You have to upload zip file which has the .ipynb notebook with implementation and dataset used.
Your project will be evaluated on following parameters -
Innovation (Max Score 10)
Generating translated text and BLEU score (Max Score 30)
Architecture of LSTM Encoder-Decoder model (Max Score 40)
Data Cleaning and Comments (Max Score 20)
